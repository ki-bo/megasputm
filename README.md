MEGASPUTM - Graphic Adventure Engine for the MEGA65

This is a re-implementation of the SPUTM interpreter to play Maniac Mansion on a MEGA65 (similar to what you probably know from ScummVM). It was written and tested to support the original Amiga game files.

In order to compile the code base, you will need the Calypsi 5.5 compiler and VICE installed (we use its c1541 tool to create the d81 disk images in the Makefile).
The code was developed using macOS, but it should be possible to amend the Makefile to let it run on other OS, as well.

Special Thanks to the ScummVM Team! MEGASPUTM was made possible thanks to their extensive wiki and codebase, which provided invaluable insights into the details of SCUMM games.
